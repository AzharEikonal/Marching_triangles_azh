This repository contains the triangular version of the marching squares algorithm. In marching squares, a square mesh is given with the level set function values defined on vertices, and the algo gives us the zero level set of this function as a curve in 2D. 
Here, we are using the same techniqie but it is for the triangular meshes. As triangular meshes are very common to sample the object in both 2D and 3D (surface), there is a need to extend this algo for the triangular meshes. 
This repo contains the main file marching_tr.py written in python, and the user have to make a folder with the same name as the mesh filename, and must have the values of level set function defined on the vertices of this triangular mesh. 
For running this program you just write marching_tr.py <folder_name>. I expect you have .obj file for mesh and .txt file for level set values.
